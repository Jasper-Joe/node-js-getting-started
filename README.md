# Lab: The Server Side using Node.js and Heroku

## Aspects of the work
1. Implemented POST /rides endpoint function that returns JSON [] as response.
2. Deployed the application onto Heroku following the instruction. 
3. Tested with both Postman and curl. 

## Collaboration
I did the lab on my own. I learned how to deploy the application onto Heroku via https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started. 

## Hours spent on the lab
I spent 30 minutes finishing the lab.
